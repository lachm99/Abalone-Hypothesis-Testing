```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
#install.packages("palmerpenguins")
library(palmerpenguins)
?penguins
# https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins
glimpse(penguins)

# plot bill length against depth
```


```{r}
penguins %>% group_by(species) %>% count()

penguins %>% ggplot() + 
  aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm',se = FALSE,colour = 'yellow')+
  geom_smooth(aes(colour = species), method = 'lm', se=F)


```

This is a classic example of simpson's paradox, as when you don't consider the species, there will be a downward sloping regressive model. Once your include the new variable of species the slopes change for the 3 types of penguins. Thus yellow line is not when species is considered and the red, green, blue line is when species is considered.
