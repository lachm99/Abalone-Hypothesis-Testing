# Abstract
abstract: |
  We are doing multiple regression on an abalone dataset with 4177 observations with 9 different variables to see if we could use several physical measurements to predict the rings of abalones,which gives us the ages of abalones in years.In order to select an appropriate model, we did some log transformation and square root of transformations to appropriately fit the observed values into model.In addition to that we ran forward and backward approach in distinguishing the most appropriate model and finally interpret the result from the model.

## Introduction 

Use multiple regression to analyse a data set of abalones with multiple predictor variables,namely whole weight,shuck weight,viscera weight,shell weight,diameters,length,height of the abalones.



## Data set

The original data was collected by the Marine Resources Division in Taroona, Tasmania. The current set is provided by the University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository. It contains 4177 observations with 8 different numerical variables, 1 categorical and no missing value. 2 unwanted outliers were found in the height variable which will be disregarded. 
 
In detail, main variables that were analysed were physical attributes of the abalone ranging from dimensions of the length, diameter of the shell, the height of the abalone captured in millimeters and weighting variables that encompass specific weights varying from the weight of the meat, after bleeding to the weight of the shell captured in grams. After some typing and data type corrections, Rings is the most relevant and suitable variable to Age that is the variable to be predicted. 


## Analysis

Assumptions:
* Linearity:there’s no obvious curvature in the residual vs fitted values plot,looks linear enough.
* Independence:the data was independently collected over 5 different regions in the tasman sea as the article about the dataset said.
* Homoskedasticity: the residuals don’t appear to be fanning out or changing their variability over the range of the fitted values.

* Normality:In the QQ plot, the points are reasonably close to the diagonal line,except for the trivial bottom 5 or so points.


## Results:

Investigation Question: Can we predict the number of rings abalones have, using only an abalones physical attributes which are easily and quickly measured?

* All variables have significant p-values giving evidence that there is a significant relationship between them and the square root log of the number of rings. 
* When we examine the significance of each level of our sex variable, we decided to retain the sex factor of whether abalones are infants or adults rather than whether abalones are male, female or infant due to how the p-value of sex_female not providing enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis that coefficient is equal to zero. This is done by utilising stepping forward and stepping backwards AICs, we have arrived at two models with the same adjusted R^2 thus we need to encompass the RMSE and MAE to identify the better performing model. 

**Cross validation** was used to compute RMSE and MAE to account for and minimise overfitting. RMSE and MAE values of the backward model are slightly smaller compared to forward model’s. Hence we proceed with the backward model.

Therefore the following is our model,

Which can be translated into an equivalent model

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
\widehat{\sqrt{log(rings)}} = 1.45 + 0.20 log(whole)\\
       &- 0.19 log(shucked) - 0.02 log(viscera) \\
       &+ 0.11 log(shell) + 0.07 log(diameter)\\
       &- 0.08 log(length) + 0.12 \sqrt{height}\\
       &- 0.01 Sex_{infant}\\
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
\widehat{log(rings)} = 2.1025 + 0.08log(whole)\\
       &- 0.0722 log(shucked) - 0.0008log(viscera) \\
       &+ 0.0242 log(shell) + 0.0098log(diameter)\\
       &- 0.0128 log(length) + 0.0144(height)\\
       &- 0.0001 Sex_{infant}^2\\
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}


On average a one percent increase in:

* Whole weight will result in a 0.08% change in number of rings
* Shucked weight will result in a 0.0722% change in number of rings
* Viscera weight will result in a 0.0008% change in number of rings
* Shell weight will result in a 0.0242% change in number of rings
* Diameter will result in a 0.0098% change in number of rings
*Length will result in a 0.0128% change in number of rings

And on average, a one unit increase in:

* Height will result in a 0.0144 x 100% change in number of rings
* Sex_infant will result in a 0.0001 x 100% change in number of rings



## Discussion and conclusion:

The PNAS sample included a fixed PNG image here, but this document prefers
to show the results and embedding of _R_ code.
